# Method for building Lambda Functions.
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Code must be given as a single python file called lambda.py. This is highly coupled with the definition 
# of the Lambda Function. See the README.md for a link to the repository containing infrastructure setup.
# 2. If the code has any external dedpendencies, they must be placed in a requirements.txt file within the same directory.

# This method first zips the lambda.py file and then checks if dependencies are present. If they are present, it installs
# and packages those as well.

# Received parameters:
# $1 - Path to Lambda directory from the current working directory.
